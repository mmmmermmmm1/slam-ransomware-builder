 <h2 align="center">slam ransomware builder</h2>
</p>
 a ransomware compiler that uses the AES256 encryption algorithm, uses vulnerabilities of all kinds and is 100% configurable. In the future the following functions will be added: ransomware mbr, screen locker and LogonUI overwriter
 it has features that NO OTHER COMPILER HAS, it is completely free and easy to use.
 use it on Windows 10-11 on others OS it will not work (but the ransomware generated works fine in windows 7 upwards).

- the mbr ransomware builder is in development (alpha 0.0.1 has been released)
- the screenlocker builder will be developed in the future
- other tools will be developed in the future

## Features

- customized ransom note, you can add variables such as the ip, the name and personal id of the victim, a list of encrypted files, etc...
- you can change the victim's wallpaper (jpg, png, jpeg, webp, tiff and bmp)
- you can see what the decryptor is doing
- you can block antivirus web pages, youtube, google etc.
- you can set a custom encryption password
- you can change the ransom note name and extension of the encrypted files.
- you can choose which directories to encrypt from the list, and if they are not in the list, you can add the paths yourself.
- you can choose which extensions to encrypt or encrypt all files
- if there is no internet you can make the ransomware inactive and add a fake error message, as soon as wifi is available the ransomware will start encrypting.
- you can empty the Recycle Bin.
- you can make the ransomware start when you turn on the pc and only encrypt files that are not already encrypted.
- you can make the ransomware ask for administrator permissions.
- you can make the ransomware have administrator permissions WITHOUT ASKING
- you can change the version, description, copyright, icon and all exe information.
- you can change the byte salt, this is very useful because if you set different bytes than the defaults ONLY YOU will be able to create the decryptor.
- you can run a cmd command, very useful to disable the task manager etc... you will also have a list with commands that I recommend you to add.
- you can send information to a server, when someone gets infected you will get a notification with the time of infection, the id etc... it is very easy to configure.
- you can delete backups.
- you can "auto destroy" the exe, that is to say, when you finish infecting the victim, the exe will be deleted.
- you can put it in critical process mode, so if you stop the infection by taskkill or task manager it will cause a bsod.
- you can infect the usb, it will create a copy of the virus with the name you want in all the usb connected.
- you can add custom c# code, with no limits, you will also have a code list that I recommend you, but make sure you know what you are doing.
- you can make a system notification with the icon and message of your choice (I guess this only works on windows 10-11)
- the builder is available in English and Spanish.
- you can set any color in the background or in the text, set a random color every time you start the program or set the builder to rainbow mode.
- you can view a log while compiling the ransomware to see the bugs or whatever, logs are also saved.
- the password is base64 encrypted to make it slightly more difficult to extract the password if the ransomware is decompiled.
